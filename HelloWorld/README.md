# Writing tests
## Writing a test is just like writing a function, with a few rules

- It needs to be in a file with a name like xxx_test.go

- The test function must start with the word Test

- The test function takes one argument only t *testing.T

- To use the *testing.T type, you need to import "testing", like we did with fmt in the other file

- For now, it's enough to know that your t of type *testing.T is your "hook" into the testing framework so you can do things like t.Fail() when you want to fail.


## t.Errorf
We are calling the Errorf method on our t, which will print out a message and fail the test. The f stands for format, which allows us to build a string with values inserted into the placeholder values %q. When you make the test fail, it should be clear how it works.

## command to run test cases

``` bash
>> go test
```
